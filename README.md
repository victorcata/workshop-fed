# Front-End Workshop (free of Frameworks...)

The idea of this workshop is to create the Front-End side starting from the graphic design that we supossely received from a Graphic designer. At this point of the development the UX Researchers and UX Designers have done their work, they have send their mockups to the Graphic Designer who had design the Look & Feel of the future website. And now, it's time for the Front-End developer to start coding the UI.

The process will start thinking in how to tuckle the project to make a Front-End architecture maintenable and an easy way to componetize the UI so we can modify it easily for future improvements. At the end, we are going to communicate our Front-End with a REST API that it's going to bring us all the data that we will need.
